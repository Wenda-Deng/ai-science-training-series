I might try to use AI to recognize hand-writing documents, and will first start from handwritten digits.

The task is to successfully classify handwritten digits to 0-9.

I will download the data from MNIST, and use the MLP that I learned from session 2 to do the task.

Since the task is relatively simple, I can just count the wrong results by myself and try to improve the accuracy as a measurement of success.
